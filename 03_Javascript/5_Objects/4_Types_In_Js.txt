Two types 
1) Primitive Types or value type
2) Reference Types or Objetcs


1)PRIMITIVE TYPES :- Number
                     String
                     Boolean
                     Undefined
                     Null 


2)Reference TYPES :- Function
                     Objetcs
                     Arrays


Difference B/W Primitive and Reference 
    In primitive data type a separate copy is created of the variable same as instance variable
    But in Refrence Variable only one copy is shared same as static varaible 

    for example:- 
                  Reference Variable
                  let a =10
                  let b = a 
                  a++ 
                  console.log(a) // 11
                  console.log(b) // 10
                 -------
         a ---->| 10  |    
                 -------

                -------
         b ---->| 10  |    
                -------     
              single copy is created for every variable    
                  
                  Objects
                  let z ={value : 10};
                  let y = z

                  z++ 
                  console.log(z) // 11
                  console.log(y) // 11

                 --------
         a ----->|  10  |<------ b
                 |      |
                 --------

                 both a and b are pointing 10 that why what ever opertion haven on the value the result will refelect to both a and b
